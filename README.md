## Overview
For the processing and analysis of the ?? we used Fiji macro that:

1. Given an intensity threshold, it identifies the location of each of the cell types in each of the channels
2. It calculates the area of each cell type and the area of their intersections in each of the slices

The macro can be found under Fiji macro
